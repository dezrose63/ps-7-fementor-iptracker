> Scaffold a modern Vite + React + Tailwind/Bootstrap app in seconds — zero config, one prompt.

A zero-config CLI to instantly scaffold a modern front-end project with **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)**, **[React](https://react.dev/learn)** (JavaScript or TypeScript), and your choice of **[Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/)** (with the new **[@tailwindcss/vite](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation#vite-plugin)** plugin) **or [Bootstrap v5](https://getbootstrap.com/)** — or no CSS framework at all.  
Optional extras (with one prompt!): **react-icons, React Router, Redux Toolkit**.  
Unnecessary files and assets are auto-cleaned, so you get a fresh, production-ready workspace in seconds.

## Features

-   **Vite + React + JavaScript/TypeScript**: Fast, modern development stack
-   **CSS Framework Choice**:  
    Choose between **Tailwind CSS v4**, **Bootstrap v5**, or _no CSS framework_
-   **Tailwind v4 with official Vite plugin** or **Bootstrap 5** ready to use instantly
-   **Extra Libraries (optional)**: Add react-icons, React Router, Redux Toolkit, Zustand, and Axios in one step
-   **Automatic Cleanup**: Removes default assets, public files, boilerplate noise
-   **Ready-to-Code**: Minimal `App.jsx` / `App.tsx`, clean folder, and CSS framework imported for you
-   **One Command, Super Fast!**

## Quick Start

_using npm:_

```sh
npm create vrtw@latest
```

### What I learned

I learned that I need a lot more practice with async Promises and API's. I also learned that even though some of these new frameworks seem like they would be the obvious go-to since they have everything I need in cone CLI cmd, I would have probablky had an easier time sticking with what I was familiar with. Even with all of the problems I encountered, I'm still glad I was able to get more experience with these new frameworks, and it's I can't wait to get more practice with coding in typescript, vite, tailwind, ect. 

I'm proud that I stuck with the React/Vite/Typescript/Tailwind setup and didn't revert back to vanilla HTML-CSS-Javascript.
